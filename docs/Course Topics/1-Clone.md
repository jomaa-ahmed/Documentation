## Clone Stage

The **Clone** stage is the initial step in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. It is responsible for cloning the source code repository from the specified URL.

### Jenkinsfile Stage for cloning:

```
stage('Clone') {
    steps {
        git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/Ahmedjomaa55/Documentation.git'
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

The stage('Clone') block defines the "Clone" stage in the Jenkins pipeline. The git step is used to clone the repository from the specified URL (https://github.com/Ahmedjomaa55/Documentation.git) and the branch (main in this case).


### Purpose:

The "Clone" stage is essential for keeping the pipeline up-to-date with the latest changes in the codebase, allowing for a consistent and reliable build and deployment process.
