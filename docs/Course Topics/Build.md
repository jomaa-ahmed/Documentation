## Build Stage

The **Build** stage is responsible for executing the build process for the application using npm.

### Jenkinsfile Snippet:

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        sh 'npm run build'
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

The stage('Build') block defines the "Build" stage in the Jenkins pipeline. The sh step is used to execute the command npm run build, which triggers the build process for the application.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this stage is to generate the production-ready artifacts of the application. The npm run build command compiles, bundles, and optimizes the source code to create the final build that is ready for deployment.
