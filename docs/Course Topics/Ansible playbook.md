## Ansible Playbook Stage

The **Ansible Playbook** stage is responsible for deploying the application using Ansible.

### Jenkinsfile Snippet:

```groovy
stage('Ansible Playbook') {
    steps {
        withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'ansibleprivatekey3', variable: 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY')]) {
            sh '''
            ls
            cat hosts
            cat ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY} > go.pem
            chmod 400 go.pem
            ansible-playbook --user=ubuntu --private-key=go.pem docker.yml -i hosts
            '''
        }
    }
}
```

Certainly! Let's proceed with the "Ansible Playbook" stage. Here's the markdown explanation for it:

## Ansible Playbook Stage

The **Ansible Playbook** stage is responsible for deploying the application using Ansible.

### Jenkinsfile Snippet:

```groovy
stage('Ansible Playbook') {
    steps {
        withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'ansibleprivatekey3', variable: 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY')]) {
            sh '''
            ls
            cat hosts
            cat ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY} > go.pem
            chmod 400 go.pem
            ansible-playbook --user=ubuntu --private-key=go.pem docker.yml -i hosts
            '''
        }
    }
}

### Explanation:

    The stage('Ansible Playbook') block defines the "Ansible Playbook" stage in the Jenkins pipeline.

    The withCredentials block securely injects the Ansible private key (from the Jenkins credentials with ID ansibleprivatekey3) as the SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY environment variable.

    The sh step executes the necessary commands to set up the Ansible environment and run the Ansible playbook (docker.yml).

    In the example, we assume that the Ansible playbook is named docker.yml and the inventory file is named hosts.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this stage is to automate the deployment of the application using Ansible. Ansible is a powerful automation tool that allows you to define infrastructure as code and deploy applications consistently across various servers or environments.

In this stage, Ansible is configured to connect to target servers using the provided private key and run the docker.yml playbook. The playbook contains the necessary tasks to pull the Docker image, start containers, and configure the application's environment.
