# Rebuild Method

1. **Evaluate Current Application:**
   - Understand what the existing monolithic application does and its main functionalities.
   - Identify pain points, slow performance, and areas that need improvement.

2. **Plan Microservices:**
   - Break down the application's main functionalities into smaller pieces, or microservices.
   - Decide which parts of the monolith will become separate microservices.

3. **Choose Technologies:**
   - Pick modern tools and technologies that are suitable for building microservices.
   - Consider languages, frameworks, and databases that best fit each microservice's needs.

4. **Build Microservices:**
   - Create each microservice separately, one by one.
   - Focus on building simple, single-purpose services that do one thing well.

5. **APIs and Communication:**
   - Design clear and easy-to-use APIs for each microservice.
   - Decide how microservices will talk to each other using APIs or messaging.

6. **Development and Testing:**
   - Develop and test each microservice individually.
   - Make sure they work well on their own before integrating them.

7. **DevOps Setup:**
   - Set up tools to automate building, testing, and deploying microservices.
   - Use containers like Docker to make deployment easier.

8. **Gradual Transition:**
   - Replace parts of the monolith with new microservices over time.
   - Start with less critical or easier-to-replace features.

9. **User Experience:**
   - Make sure the user experience remains smooth during the transition.
   - Users shouldn't notice major disruptions.

10. **Monitor and Improve:**
    - Keep an eye on the performance and reliability of each microservice.
    - Continuously improve and optimize as needed.

11. **Full Migration:**
    - Replace all parts of the monolith with microservices.
    - Ensure everything works seamlessly together.

12. **Decommission Monolith:**
    - Once you're confident in the microservices, retire the old monolithic application.
