In this course, we'll learn about the principles and practices of DevOps, with a focus on implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), gaining hands-on experience with popular DevOps tools and technologies, including Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and npm. In addition, we'll learn how to troubleshoot common issues that can arise during the CI/CD process, so that we can keep our projects running smoothly.

## Course Topics

1. **Introduction to DevOps:** We will learn what DevOps is, its principles, and why it's important in modern software development.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

2. **Clone:** Learn how to clone the source code repository using Git to get started with the CI process.

3. **Install Dependency:** Understand how to manage project dependencies using npm to ensure a smooth build process.

4. **Build:** Discover how to automate the build process using Jenkins, ensuring that the application is compiled and assembled correctly.

5. **SonarQube:** Learn how to integrate SonarQube for static code analysis to identify potential issues and improve code quality.

6. **Quality Gate:** Explore the concept of a Quality Gate, a set of conditions that must be met before the code can proceed to further stages in the CI pipeline.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

7. **Dockerize the App:** Discover how to containerize the application using Docker, making it portable and consistent across different environments.

8. **Uploading to Nexus:** Learn how to upload the Docker image to Nexus repository for version control and distribution.

9. **Pull from Nexus:** Understand how to pull the Docker image from Nexus for deployment on different servers.

10. **Ansible Playbook:** Finally, explore how to use Ansible to automate the deployment and configuration of the application on target servers.

11. **Kubernetes with ArgoCD:** At the end of the course, we will dive into using Kubernetes for container orchestration and ArgoCD for continuous deployment, enabling automated and streamlined deployment of applications in Kubernetes clusters.

Overall, we will learn how to build, test, and deploy modern software applications using DevOps principles and tools. We will also gain a solid understanding of the tools and technologies used in the DevOps process, which will help us to work more effectively in a modern software development team.
